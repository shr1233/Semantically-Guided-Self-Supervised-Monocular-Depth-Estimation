# Semantically-Guided-Self-Supervised-Monocular-Depth-Estimation
We use PyTorch 1.1 with Cuda 10.0. An requirements.txt  exists. 


In your project dir export the environment variable for the checkpoints: export IFN_DIR_CHECKPOINT=/path/to/folder/Checkpoints
Download the Cityscapes dataset: https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/ and put it in a folder "Dataset"
Download KITTI dataset: http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/ and place it in the same dataset folder. To ensure that you have the same folder structure as we have, you can directly use the script dataloader\data_preprocessing\download_kitti.py.
Prepare the dataset folder:
export an environment variable to the root directory of all datasets: export IFN_DIR_DATASET=/path/to/folder/Dataset
